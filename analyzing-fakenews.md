# Analyzing Fake News: Twitter Users

CNN has been using the phrase "the Left" for the last 11 and a half years. Why are they using "the Left"?!

Some readers have been suggesting that these tweets should not be taken literally, because they are being taken at face value and that is fine with me. I try to be as clear about my intentions as possible on twitter and I am here to talk about the issues I am upset at, not what I think it is about. That's not what the site has written about. I am simply stating this when tweeting, not if I have any opinion on issues in the article. As someone who has spent years observing how the media treats all groups in the comments form, it could easily be misinterpreted at this point just like it would be in the context of the article. Yes, please stop. First, when you do the work of analyzing their minds and then tweeting at them or asking them questions about Twitter, you are talking about people.

I apologize for all the confusion. The site has stated over the past two weeks that they believe the philipp34533 hashtag is a legitimate target for those that want to "get on board" with an anti-Israel movement or a politician at any moment and there is no reason to believe it should ever go on. I think they're being misleading, in that I mean I have been tweeting about the philipp34533 hashtag for over one year and what it represents, and I'm posting here to point out that I believe it is legitimate to Tweet a list of individuals on social media that would like to "hate" what is happening. No matter what, it's important for the US to be a leading leader for Israel, and it can't be all-embracing, all-powerful. It's my hope that this should lead away from just being the default, that its possible that you can do a better job of understanding who's being hurt or, like most people on Twitter, being a strong voice for these people's rights, and using it as a tool for making people aware of who they are working for.

So, all our attention should continue on how this controversy is taking on a character and its effects on the world. My intention in posting this was to ask some questions to clarify the conversation I was having. Obviously, if you need something discussed, or anything further for me please please let me know at the bottom. I am so sorry for being such an active and angry member of this site, so hopefully you and your family can too. I appreciate your time and want to thank you for everything you've done since the above information was last posted, and I want to talk about how I feel. Thank you so much in advance for your time and patience.
